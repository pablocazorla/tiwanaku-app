# Tiwanaku App

Tiwanaku is a wonderful deduction boardgame, created by Olivier Grégoire, illustrated by Raphaël Samakh, and originally published by Sit Down!.

Since I discovered the game, I found it wonderful, and very soon I realized that the maps included in the game would not be enough for me.

So I got to work. I’m a developer, so I came up with the idea of creating an application that could generate maps programmatically...

And here is the result!

Tiwanaku is an open-source project; it’s an application made with love and effort, and with no profit motive. It’s not official, nor does it have the publisher’s or the designer’s permission. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/pablocazorla/tiwanaku-app).

If you have any doubts, questions, or anything you need, don’t hesitate to write to me.

Enjoy it.
